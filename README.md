#Tindogs


Tindogs is a static webpage created as a practice project to showcase my front-end development skills. The page mimics a fictional app that helps dogs find their perfect match, similar to the popular dating app, Tinder. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, demonstrating various layout techniques, responsive design, and UI/UX elements.
